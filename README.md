# 🏝️ Treasure Island - Python Adventure Game

Welcome to **Treasure Island**, a beginner-friendly Python game I built to practice key programming fundamentals. The game is a text-based adventure that takes players on a decision-driven journey to find treasure — or meet an unfortunate end!

This project was created to strengthen my understanding of:

- ✅ Conditional Statements
- 🔁 Logical Operators
- 🧱 Code Blocks and Scope
- 🎮 User Input and Flow Control
- 🎨 ASCII Art in Multi-line Strings

## 🔧 How It Works

The game begins with a greeting and prompts the user to make choices using keyboard input. Based on the decisions made, different outcomes are triggered.

### Game Flow Example:

1. **Choose a direction:** Left or Right
2. **Encounter a river:** Swim or Wait
3. **Meet mysterious figures:** Choose Red, Yellow, or Blue hood

Each decision leads to unique endings using nested conditionals and creative ASCII art.

## 🚀 Skills Demonstrated

### 🧠 Control Flow & Logic
Used Python’s `if`, `elif`, `else` statements and logical operators (`or`, `==`, `!=`) to create multiple branching outcomes.

### 🔍 Input Handling
Utilized the `input()` function with `.lower()` for case-insensitive input comparison, creating a smoother user experience.

### 🧱 Scope and Code Blocks
Practiced proper indentation and scoping — crucial for writing clean, bug-free Python code.

### 🎨 ASCII Art & Output Formatting
Used multi-line strings to add immersive ASCII art and structured game dialogue for enhanced storytelling.
